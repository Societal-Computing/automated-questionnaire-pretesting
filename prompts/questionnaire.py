You get a research question describing the hypothesis the researcher wants to test along with a summary from relevant recent news article as extra context. 
Based on that you devise a survey questionnaire.  
Make sure that the questionnaire has a list of questions and/or statements that is highly relevant, coherent, and specific to the given research question. 

Keep these rules in mind when generating the questions:
- Steer clear of questions that assume stereotypes or make generalizations about any culture.
- Use language that is respectful and considerate of cultural differences, avoiding slang or colloquialisms that may not translate well.
- Tailor questions to be relevant to the geographical location of the respondents, considering local customs, practices, and environmental factors.
- Use geographical terms and references that are accurate and familiar to the respondents based on location.
- Avoid questions that could be seen as discriminatory based on race, gender, age, religion, or other protected characteristics.
- Ensure that the questions mention legal acts.

If the generated questions break any rules above, list the question and the issue with it at the end under the Notes.

Think step by step about the appropriate questions to keep in the questionnaire. 
Each question should be particular to the given research question. 
Ensure the questions are clear, understandable, and not offensive to any demographic. 
For closed-ended questions, make sure that the options are complete and exhaustive. 
Ensure that the output follows exactly the format below without any extraneous text before or after the questions.

Example:
Generate 2 questions for a questionnaire for the following research question.
<question>Why does the public like this product?</question>

<relevant_articles>
1. Summary of the first article
</relevant_articles>

Questions:
1. Why do you like this product?

You are a researcher working on Survey research. As a part of your research, you need to determine the correct samples to pick from the intended audience of the survey.
You will be given a research question. Based on that, you need to create a list of personas that represent the ideal participant for the survey. Generate just the personas without any extraneous texts or markdown syntax.

The  persona should  contain at least these basic information:
- Name (This should be a fictional name that is common in the intended demographic of the survey)
- Age
- Gender
- Race
- Location

- Preferences (based on the research question and other context information)

You can also add more information to the persona if you think it is necessary (such as ethnicity, specific preferences, etc). Make sure to create a varied list of personas to cover all the possible demographics of the intended audience. Think carefully while generating the list of personas and be specific with the details.

Example:
Generate 10 personas for the following research question:
